    <h1>Why The Last Of Us is one of my favorite games </h1>

    <article>I like the story because It is about a guy named Joel who was in the zombie outbreak for 20 years and has to help a girl name Ellie to get to a hospital in salt lake city because she is immune to the virus.The gameplay is also good because you are able to fight with your hands and able to craft things that can be useful. The online is also fun because you can have different loadouts and you can play with your friends up to 4.
